Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis
🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Airbnb listing prices using machine learning.
Pricing an Airbnb property correctly is crucial for both hosts and travellers:

Hosts want to maximize occupancy and revenue.

Travellers seek fair and competitive prices.

Using historical Airbnb data, this project builds a regression model that learns relationships between various features — such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and guest ratings — and the final price charged.
The trained model can be used to predict prices for new or hypothetical listings, helping property owners make data-driven pricing decisions.

🧠 Objectives

Clean and preprocess Airbnb listing data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

Build and train machine learning regression models

Evaluate performance and interpret feature importance

Provide actionable insights for hosts, travellers, and analysts

⚙️ Technologies Used

📊 Project Workflow

Data Loading: Imported Airbnb dataset (CSV/Excel format).

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between price and key attributes

Identified trends and correlations

Feature Engineering: Selected important variables influencing price.

Model Building:

Applied regression algorithms (Linear Regression, etc.)

Tuned parameters for best performance

Evaluation: Measured accuracy using standard metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).

Prediction: Generated price predictions for new listings.

👥 Target Audience
Group	Purpose
Airbnb Hosts	Optimize pricing strategies based on property features and guest reviews
Travellers	Evaluate whether listings are reasonably priced
Airbnb Platform Analysts	Improve automated pricing suggestions and trust
Researchers / Students	Study how property attributes affect rental pricing
📈 Results

Built a regression model that can accurately predict Airbnb prices

Identified key drivers affecting listing price (e.g., location, bedrooms, ratings)

Created visual insights to support decision-making for different stakeholders

💻 How to Run
